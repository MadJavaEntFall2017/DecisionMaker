# DecisionMaker
Mack's team's project for JavaEE fall 2017.

# Problem Statement

Our problem is that the magic eight ball is outdated and we want something that could be crude or not, indecisive or not
and if you want an irritated answer if you irritated or not. Well the magic eight ball does'nt offer that functionality, that's why 
we are making an application that people can call and you can tell it if you want an answer for something depending on what your feeling.

# The Solution

We are going to make a decision maker for people who want an answer and cant come up with something either clever or anything at all.
but there's a kick, in our we have three choices to add to your decision to make it that much better! You can either choose to have a little 
crudness in the answer, or an indecisive answer to give it to someone you dont like or don't want to talk to. Lastly you can add a little
 irritatedness to the answer if your not feeling what you are doing, or don't again want to talk to someone.
